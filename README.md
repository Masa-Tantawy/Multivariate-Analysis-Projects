Project 1: Babies Multivariate Analysis - Outlier Detection and Hotelling's T2 test

This project’s dataset provides information on a variety of features that pertain to the pregnancy process, as well as measurements of the mother and child after the delivery’s completion. Identifying outliers is an integral part of this process, as any data points that fall too out of range indicate issues with the pregnancy that require immediate medical attention. The aim of this project is to study two sets of key traits included in the dataset: smokers and first-time mothers. Through the application of Hotelling's T2 test and the BACON algorithm, this project clarifies any differences between mothers who smoke and those who don’t, as well as between mothers experiencing first pregnancies and those experiencing successive ones. 


Project 2: Fake Bills Multivariate Analysis - Discriminant and Cluster Analysis

In this project, the dataset provides details about the dimensions of various genuine and fake U.S. dollar bills. The aim is to apply the multivariate analysis technique: discriminant analysis and cluster analysis, as well as other methods during data preparation, in order to distinguish genuine mention from its counterfeit counterpart thus allowing for better identification of fake dollar bills. These technique also allow us to single out any confounding outliers and test the statistical make-up of the data. 


Project 3: India's Monsoon Season Rainfall - Principal Component Analysis

India’s monsoon season, typically lasting from June to September, is its wettest time of year and is an integral element of India's agriculture and economy. The rain despite being vital for  irrigation and other important reasons, it can be destructive. Therefore, analyzing the patterns of rainfall throughout the year could facilitate the identification of relationships existing within the data, allowing for better and more accurate predictions on future rainfall events. This project aims to apply the Principal Component Analysis technique on data about this very topic, so that an improved analysis of the variations present between the data’s multiple variables can be made through the reduction of its dimensionality.
