Project 1: Babies Multivariate Analysis - Outlier Detection and Hotelling's T2 test

This project’s dataset (babies.csv) provides information on a variety of features that pertain to the pregnancy process, as well as measurements of the mother and child after the delivery’s completion. Identifying outliers is an integral part of this process, as any data points that fall too out of range (especially with features pertaining to the weights of mothers or children or the gestation period) indicate issues with the pregnancy that require immediate medical attention. We will be applying multivariate techniques, namely Hotelling's T2 test and the BACON algorithm, to identify and handle outliers and establish statistical qualities.
The aim of this project is to study two sets of key traits included in the dataset: smokers and first-time mothers. Through the application of multivariate analysis, this project clarifies any differences between mothers who smoke and those who don’t, as well as between mothers experiencing first pregnancies and those experiencing successive ones. This project was written in R.
